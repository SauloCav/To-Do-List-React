# To-Do List App

## Overview

This is a simple to-do list application created with React. It allows users to manage their tasks effectively. You can add new tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them when you're done.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the application.

  - `App.js`: The main component that renders the entire application.
  - `components/`: This directory contains the reusable components used throughout the app.
  - `data/`: Contains the sample data used to populate the initial to-do list.
  - `styles/`: Contains the CSS files for styling the app.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: You can add new tasks to the list by entering a task description and clicking the "Add" button.

- **Remove Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
